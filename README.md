README for jhipsterwebsocket
==========================

This is an example repository for a webapp generated using [jhipster](https://jhipster.github.io/) with an example websocket message. If you run the app and open it up in the webbrowser, it will add example messages sent via websocket to the bottom of the main frame every 5 seconds.
